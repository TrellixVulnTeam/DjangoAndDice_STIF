Django and Dice is a complete character sheet app for Dungeons and Dragons (DnD),
a fantasy tabletop role-playing game. As currently there is no app that really fits our
needs, I created this for me and my friends. The website allows you to create your own
character, look up your spells, manage your equipment and much more. It also consists
of a registration/login system, permanent data storage and ajax technology to make it
more user-friendly.


Stack/techniques used: Python, HTML/CSS/JQuery, Ajax, Heroku, Pytest, Selenium, DB
